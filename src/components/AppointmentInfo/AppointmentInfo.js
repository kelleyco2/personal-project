                        Realistic expectations are important when getting eyelash estensions. I can only put on extensions that your natural lash can support. If you have few lashes or they are short and thin then unfortunately I can't put long/thick extensions on. I would never hurt the health of your natural lash.

                        Make sure you don't have any make up on when you come in for your appointments. It is very important that I have squeaky clean lashes so the glue will adhere to your lash.

                        Classic full sets take up to 2 hours and fills take an hour.

                        You should have 40% of your extensions still on when you come in for a fill. If you don't we should may consider your fill times closer together.

                        You will not have good retention with lashes if you come in with unclean lashes or if you dont take care of them between fills.

                        During your appointment you can talk all you want, but try not to talk with your hands and be careful with facial expressions that will move your eyes.
